# Atlas API
A small asynchronous wrapper for Iris's Atlas API, made to retrieve story metadata from FanFiction.Net (or FFN).

Note: The authentication credentials necessary to actually access the API aren't included. For those, talk to [Iris](https://github.com/iridescent-beacon). For a description of the API being wrapped, see Iris's OpenAPI-style specification [here](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://atlas.fanfic.dev/openapi.yaml).
